Rejuvenation (arcane, necromancy) When a lich is destroyed, its soul immediately transfers to its phylactery. A lich can be permanently destroyed only if its phylactery is found and destroyed.

Frightful Presence
A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to this monster’s Frightful Presence for 1 minute.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected by the presence.

Failure The creature is frightened 2.
Critical Failure The creature is frightened 4. (aura, emotion, fear, mental) 60 feet, DC 29

Counterspell  Trigger A creature casts a spell the lich has prepared. Effect The lich expends a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature’s casting of that same spell. The lich loses its spell slot as if it had cast the triggering spell. The lich then attempts to counteract the triggering spell.

Drain Phylactery  Frequency once per day; Effect The lich taps into its phylactery’s power to cast any arcane spell up to 6th level, even if the spell being cast is not one of the lich’s prepared spells. The lich’s phylactery doesn’t need to be present for the lich to use this ability.

Paralyzing Touch (arcane, curse, incapacitation, necromancy) A creature damaged by the lich’s hand Strike must succeed at a Fortitude save against DC 32. The creature becomes paralyzed for 1 round on a failure. On a critical failure, the creature is paralyzed permanently, falls prone, and seems dead. A DC 25 Medicine check reveals the victim is alive.

Steady Spellcasting If a reaction would disrupt the lich’s spellcasting action, the lich attempts a DC 15 flat check. On a success, the action isn’t disrupted.`;

Nature Empathy The dryad queen can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on and make very simple Requests of animals and plants.

Tied to the Land A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as blight that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract level equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region.

Change Shape  (polymorph, primal, transmutation) Nymph queens can transform between their original form, which looks much like a typical nymph of their kind, and any Small or Medium humanoid form, typically choosing a more humanoid-looking version of their natural form.

Focus Beauty  (emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, primal, visual) The nymph queen focuses her beauty upon a target within her aura. The creature must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it is affected as if by the nymph queen’s nymph’s beauty aura; if it was already affected by the aura, the target suffers the effects of a failed save against charm. A nymph queen can focus Beauty on a given creature only once per turn.

Inspiration  (emotion, enchantment, mental, primal) A nymph queen can inspire a single intelligent creature by giving that creature a token of her favor, typically a lock of her hair. As long as the creature carries her token and remains in good standing with the nymph queen, the creature gains a +1 status bonus to all Crafting checks, Performance checks, and Will saves.

If a nymph queen grants her Inspiration to a bard and the nymph queen is that bard’s muse, the bard gains an additional benefit depending on their muse theme: for lore muse, the bard also gains a +1 status bonus to all Lore checks; for maestro muse, the status bonus to Performance checks increases to +2 for the purpose of determining the effects of compositions; for polymath muse, the bard gains a +4 status bonus to untrained skill checks; and for all other muses, the Will save bonus increases to +2 against fey.

Success The duration is 1 round.

Critical Failure The duration is permanent.
Flaming Armament (divine, evocation) Any
weapon gains the effect of a flaming property
rune while a balisse wields it.
Guiding Angel [one-action] (divine, transmutation)
While invisible, a balisse can spiritually
attach itself to a non-evil mortal. When it
does so, it merges with the mortal’s body and
is unable to use any of its spells and abilities
other than to interact with the mortal. It must
use Guiding Angel again to leave the mortal. While
merged with the mortal, the balisse can take a form
of its choice that only the mortal can see, such as a
small angel on the mortal’s shoulder. Alternatively, it
can communicate with the mortal using a bodiless
voice only the mortal can hear.`

Corpse Disguise (exploration) The graveshell conceals its true nature over the

shell before partially submerging itself in water. It has an automatic result of
22 on Deception checks and DCs to pass as a corpse floating in the water.
AC 17 (19 while withdrawn into its shell); Fort +8; Ref +2; Will +4

Shell Block [reaction] Trigger The graveshell takes damage from a physical attack while
withdrawn into its shell (see Shell Game below). Effect The graveshell reduces
the damage from the attack by an amount equal to its shell’s Hardness. A
graveshell’s shell has a Hardness of 6, 10 Hit Points, and a Broken Threshold
of 5. If its shell is broken, the graveshell can’t attack with shell spikes, nor can
it use Shell Game. If the shell is destroyed, the graveshell’s AC is reduced
to 16. As long as a graveshell is alive, its shell naturally repairs
itself after a week.

Soul Siphon (aura, divine, force, necromancy) 30 feet. An astradaemon draws power
from the souls of the recently slain. If a Small or larger living creature dies within its
aura, the astradaemon gains 5 temporary Hit Points and a +1 status bonus to attack
and damage rolls for 1 round, unless the creature was slain by an astradaemon’s
Devour Soul ability. Incorporeal undead and living spirits traveling outside the
body take 1d8 force damage each round within the daemon’s aura from
the spiritual pressure as the astradaemon pulls in fragments of their soul.
Displacement (divine, illusion, visual) An astradaemon bends light, appearing
shifted from its true position, though still in the same space. Creatures
targeting the astradaemon must attempt a DC 11 flat check, as if the
astradaemon were hidden, even though it remains observed. Effects such as the
Blind-Fight feat and halfling’s keen eyes that apply on the flat check against
hidden creatures also apply against a displaced astradaemon.

Devour Soul [one-action] (divine, incapacitation,
necromancy) Requirements The astradaemon
hasn’t used an action with the attack trait yet
this turn. Effect The astradaemon draws out
and consumes the soul of a living creature it
has grabbed. The creature must succeed at
a DC 35 Fortitude save or instantly die. If it
dies, the astradaemon gains 10 temporary
Hit Points and a +2 status bonus to attack
and damage rolls for 1 minute, or for 1
day if the victim was 15th level or higher.
A victim slain in this way can be returned
to life normally. A creature that survives is
temporarily immune for 1 minute.
Essence Drain (divine, necromancy, negative) When an
astradaemon hits with its claw, jaws, or tail, it drains the target’s spiritual and
vital essences. The target takes 2d10 negative energy damage and the astradaemon
regains an equal number of Hit Points. The target must succeed at a DC
37 Fortitude save or become doomed 1 and drained 1. If
the target was already drained or doomed, it instead
increases both conditions’ value by 1, to a maximum

projections. This acts as telepathy with a range of 100 feet but is understandable to all

Fate Drain (curse, divine, mental) A creature
damaged by the theletos’s tentacle must
succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become
stupefied 1. As long as the creature is stupefied, it can
no longer benefit from fortune effects. If the target fails additional
saves against this ability, the condition value increases by 1 (to a
maximum of stupefied 4). This condition value decreases by 1
every 24 hours.
Wrath of Fate [two-actions] (curse, divine, mental, misfortune) The
theletos releases a 60-foot cone of energy from its center.
Creatures in the cone become overwhelmed with
the knowledge of various fates that destiny has in
store for them and lack of clear pathways to
these potential futures. They must succeed at 
a DC 26 Will save or be slowed 1 indefinitely. An affected creature can choose to roll
twice when it attempts an attack, saving throw, or skill check and take the lower result.
Regardless of the outcome, that creature is no longer slowed after that roll. The theletos
can’t use Wrath of Fate again for 1d4 rounds.`
